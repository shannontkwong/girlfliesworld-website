            My goal is to fly around the world solo, which includes flying across the entire Antarctic continent, unassisted. I have chosen a route that crosses all 7 continents, large oceans, as well as the entirety of the Antarctic continent â€“ a route that has rarely been successful before in a small plane. The entire journey will be a mix of adventures as well as unique challenges.
          <br></br>  <br></br>          To qualify for the GWR, I must land or overfly the South Pole successfully and touch all continents.
