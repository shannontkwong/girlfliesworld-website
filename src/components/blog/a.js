    content: `Welcome to my aviation blog, where I'll be sharing the incredible experiences, challenges, and triumphs from my record-breaking flight around the world.
  
    **The Journey**
  
  I'm embarking on something that has never been done before by a woman - a solo flight around the world in a small aircraft, covering all 7 continents in a westbound direction, including a historic flight to the South Pole.
  
  This isn't just about breaking records; it's about pushing the boundaries of what's possible and inspiring others to chase their dreams, no matter how impossible they might seem.
  
  **What You'll Find Here**
  
  This blog will be my window into this extraordinary adventure. I'll be posting whenever something significant happens - whether it's:
  
  - **Pre-flight preparations** and the countless hours of planning
  - **In-flight experiences** from remote airstrips to breathtaking aerial views
  - **Technical challenges** and how we overcome them
  - **Cultural encounters** in the far corners of our planet
  - **Personal reflections** on fear, determination, and discovery
  - **Behind-the-scenes moments** that don't make the headlines
  
  **The Records**
  
  This flight represents several aviation milestones:
  
  - **First woman to fly solo to the South Pole** in a small aircraft
  - **Solo westbound circumnavigation** touching all 7 continents
  - **Longest polar flight** by a woman in a single-engine aircraft
  
  But beyond the records, this is about proving that with enough determination, preparation, and courage, we can achieve the extraordinary.
  

 **The Adventure Begins**
  
  The engines are warming up, the flight plans are filed, and the adventure of a lifetime is about to begin. I'm honored to have you along for this incredible journey.
  
  Stay tuned for updates from the cockpit, and remember - the sky is never the limit when you have the courage to fly beyond it.

  summary: 'A raw look into the mindset behind surviving extremes — the cost, the pain, and the fire that drives me forward.',
  content: `For the past six months, I’ve been sleeping four hours a night, going to bed at 6 or 7 in the morning, only to wake up and do it all again. I work 100-hour weeks with no pay. My health, my mind, my emotions — they’re all collateral. Sometimes I forget to eat. Sometimes I don’t see daylight for weeks. I haven’t taken a single day off or gone on a holiday for the past 1.5 years. And still, I keep going.

My brain is wired for extremes. It’s all or nothing. That’s not ambition — it’s survival. When your life starts with loss, chaos, and no one to catch you, your system learns one rule: don’t fuck it halfway. Go all in, or don’t bother showing up.

Every day I cry like a baby. Every day I want to give up. I feel like I’m experiencing more stress right now, in a single stretch of time, than most 40- or 50-year-olds ever will across their entire lives.

I lost my mom at ten. My dad wasn’t there enough to be a dad. Since then, I’ve been my own parent, teacher, and fuel source. So yeah, I build things from scratch, I take risks that make people stare, and I chase goals most people think are insane — like flying solo to Antarctica. But to me, it’s familiar. My nervous system only knows high stakes.

Comfort has never felt safe to me — intensity does. That’s where I come alive.
